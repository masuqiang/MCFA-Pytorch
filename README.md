1. This code is for the paper of  Multi-level Cross-modal Feature Alignment via Contrastive Learning towards Zero-shot 
Classification of Remote Sensing Image Scenes, which is submitted to TGRS. 

2. The code has been implemented based on that of CADA-VAE. The data can be available at link "链接：https://pan.baidu.com/s/1-0lZaggJCeHJtOto8V35pw 
提取码：smhw"

3. The data we have used for experiments are included, which can be seen in the folder of data. 

4. All the parameters including the data path  are set in file of the single_experiment.py. 

5. The code should be run under the environment of Pytorch. When running the code, you can just run the single_experiment.py. 

6. If there are some problems, please email to liuchun through liuchun@henu.edu.cn.
